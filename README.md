# MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisor Template

This template provides a solid foundation for developing Expert Advisors (EAs) on MT5. It includes pre-built modules for trade management, risk settings, and signal generation.

## File Structure

- **Template.mq5**  
  The main EA file that initializes your trading logic and event handlers.

- **Header.mqh**  
  Contains input parameters and global settings like risk management, trading hours, and custom indicators.

- **Trade_Functions.mqh**  
  Provides functions to open, close, and partially close trades.

- **Risk_Functions.mqh**  
  Implements calculations for stop-loss, take-profit, and dynamic lot sizing based on risk.

- **Signal_Functions.mqh**  
  Holds indicator initialization and functions to detect entry/exit signals.

## How to Use

1. Copy the entire template folder into your MT5 Experts directory.
2. Open **Template.mq5** in MetaEditor.
3. Customize inputs in **Header.mqh** to adjust trading hours, risk parameters, and indicator settings.
4. Modify the signal conditions in **Signal_Functions.mqh** to define your entry and exit criteria.
5. Tweak trade and risk functions in **Trade_Functions.mqh** and **Risk_Functions.mqh** if necessary.
6. Compile the EA and test it using the Strategy Tester or on a demo account before deploying live.
